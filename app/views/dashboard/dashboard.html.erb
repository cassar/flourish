  <summary>How does it work?</summary>
  <p>Members contribute what they can every week into a shared pool, and that pool is then divided at the end of the week equally between all members of the group.</p>
  <p>There is no minimum that members are required to give every week and anyone can join.</p>
  <p>Distributions will occure on weeks where the minimum dividend has been met, otherwise the funds go over to the next week's pool.</p>
  <p>The minimum dividend is currently <%= minimum_dividend_formatted %> per member.</p>
