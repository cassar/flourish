  <summary>How does it work?</summary>
  <p>Members contribute what they can every week into a shared pool, and that pool is then divided at the end of the week equally between all members of the group.</p>
  <p>There is no minimum that members are required to give every week and anyone can join.</p>
  <p>If the minimum dividend is not met at the time of the weekly distribution, then no funds will be distributed and the funds get transfered to the next week's pool.</p>
