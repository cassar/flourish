  <p>Hey Flourishites ðŸ‘‹</p>
  <p><strong>Development</strong><p>
  <p>Have been filling out the <%= link_to 'home', root_url %> and  <%= link_to 'about', about_url %> pages this week.</p>
  <p>One addition to the home page, and, a bit of an accounting trick, but if all the recontributions and contributions are counted, Flourishites have contributed $1,991.71 AUD in funds over 12 distributions. Also, Flourish has issued $1,798.63 AUD in dividends.</p>
  <p><strong>Community Trials</strong><p>
  <p>I've been having chats with a few people interested in starting community trials, and it got me a little interested in expanding Flourish to make it easier to do this; how it might work: an admin starts a group and invites existing contacts to join; they would contribute to their own pool, which would be divided amongst themselves.<p>
  <p>I've resisted this idea to date, as Flourish was meant to be about putting more trust in strangers and reducing fear, but if it means more people warmed to the principle in general, I'd be willing to give it a go if there was a community of people, like 50-100, that were willing to be the first group.</p>
  <p>All the best</p>
