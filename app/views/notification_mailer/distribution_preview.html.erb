  <p>Hey Flourishites ðŸ‘‹</p>
  <p><strong>Mission</strong></p>
  <p>I've published the Mission, Goals, and Values, and have been tweaking based on feedback if anyone would care to review and comment.</p>
  <p>I think these are important in order to start asking the right questions. I'm keen to look at the approach taken by games, charities, and fledgling political parties if anyone has any input.</p>

  <p><strong>Development</strong></p>
  <p>Work is about half way done to enable all other PayPal supported currencies, this means that members based outside of Australia, which is Hong Kong and Taiwan currently, will be able to participate using their home or preferred currencies.</p>
