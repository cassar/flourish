  <p>Hey Flourishites!</p>
  <p>A steady stream of cleaning up over the last week, but nothing member facing. At least one person tweaked their notification preferences which was great to see.</p>
  <p>Thank you to the people who reached out to me after my call out last week for new members. One suggestion was to do more posts on Reddit; I did <%= link_to "a couple", "https://www.reddit.com/r/EffectiveAltruism/comments/1i4rj4r/project_for_more_giving/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button" %> but they ended up getting taken down more or less immediately.</p>
  <p>It was a good exercise, and I'll be on the look out for a couple of places to post each week, but it did highlight the need for me to do more in person presentations and more development and iteration.</p>
  <p>All the best!</p>
