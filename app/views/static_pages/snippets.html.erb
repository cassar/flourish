  <h2 style="color: lightgreen;">Don't Panic</h2>

  <h2>Post Fear</h2>
  <p>Flourish is a scaffold, and what it is facilitating is Post Fear.</p>
  <p>We don't have to be so hard on each other, we don't have to make little children sit still at desks, and or make welfare recipients apply for jobs, and the world won't fall apart.</p>

  <h2>Post Scarcity</h2>
  <p>Working backwards from abundant housing, food, and stuff.</p>
  <p>Working backwards from Ring Worlds, Dyson Swarms.</p>
  <p>A Bordem based, rather than a fear based, economy. People solving real problems.</p>

  <h2>A Trust System</h2>
  <p>Letâ€™s trust that others will give what they can and use what they need and see what happens.</p>
  <p>Public goods over exchange</p>
  <p>Trust over fear</p>
  <p>Meaningful work will always get done.</p>
  <p>Imagine what the world would look like if people did things only if they really wanted to.</p>

  <p>Entrenched scarcity mentality.</p>
