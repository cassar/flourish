  <h2>A System of Silos based on Fear and Exchange</h2>
  <p>Our current system is built from violence and maintained by fear.</p>
  <p>It is characterised by silos of resources, which are only released when something of equal value is exchanged.</p>
  <p>Don't have anything to trade? Have no interest in doing a task? Well then you're going to starve.</p>
  <p>Look around you, and you'll see the bricks of these silos: Locked doors and fences, to borders and armies.</p>
  <p>No one person was responsible for creating it, and no one person can change it.</p>
  <p>It reduces us to cogs in a machine and with an entrenched collective scarcity mentality.</p>

  <h2>A System of Commons based on Trust and Contribution</h2>
  <p>Apparently we as humans are fundumentally good.</p>
  <p>It's only the system that nudges us to unproductive and distructive behaviour.</p>
  <p>The basis of the the system of fear and silos, is exchange.</p>
  <p>I will only give you something, if I get something of equal value in return.</p>
  <p>This is the impetus that creates the silos in the first place.</p>
  <p>These are the bricks that constitute it's structure.</p>
  <p>Resources that could have gone to providing sheldering us, are used to box us in.</p>
  <p>That is the habit that we need to break; one interaction at a time.</p>

  <h2>A Simple Feedback Loop</h2>
  <p>People contribute.</p>
  <p>Monkey See, Monkey Do.</p>
  <p>People contribute more.</p>
  <h3>Communism as a Service</h3>
  <p>From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.</p>
  <p>More people able to help, more people able to be helped, and in turn help others.</p>

  <h2>Flourish</h2>
  <p>Spread soil around and watch things grow.</p>
  <h3>Lasting Political Change</h3>
  <p>More people, with more needs met, means more compromise, and more contentment.</p>
  <h3>Reduce the Distance from Harm</h3>
  <p>Less people forced to do harm in order to get money, means less harm.</p>
  <h3>Antidote to Fear and Dread.</h3>
  <p>Uplifting</p>
  <p>Don't Panic</p>
  <h3>Global Feedback View</h3>
  <p>See the world become a better place in real time.</p>
  <p>A dividend is an indication of how much we are willing to trust each other.</p>
  <p>A vote for an alternate system</p>
  <h3>A Rolling Election</h3>
  <p>A rolling referendum on our current system.</p>
  <p>Putting the commons to the test</p>
  <p>Choosing a different way to live, one dollar at a time.</p>
  <p>A measure of how willing we are to transition to a system where resources are willingly shared and our full potential realised.</p>
  <p>Removing a brick from the top of our fence, and seeing if our neighbors do the same.<p>

  <h2>Post Fear</h2>
  <p>Letâ€™s trust that others will give what they can and use what they need and see what happens.</p>
  <p>Meaningful work will always get done.</p>
  <p>Flourish is a scaffold, and what it is facilitating is Post Fear.</p>
  <p>We don't have to be so hard on each other, we don't have to make little children sit still at desks, and or make welfare recipients apply for jobs, and the world won't fall apart.</p>

  <h2>Post Scarcity</h2>
  <p>Imagine what the world would look like if people did things only if they really wanted to.</p> 
  <p>Working backwards from abundant housing, food, and stuff.</p>
  <p>Working backwards from Ring Worlds, Dyson Swarms.</p>
  <p>A Bordem based, rather than a fear based, economy. People solving real problems.</p>
